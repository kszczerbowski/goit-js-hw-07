A little project created as a GoIT homework :)
01-gallery - a JS script uses basicLightbox library (https://basiclightbox.electerious.com/) to create a gallery in which you can maximize and minimize picturec on click (to minimize you can also use ESC key)
02-lightbox - a JS script uses simpleLightbox library (https://simplelightbox.com/) to create a gallery similar to the one from 01-gallery, but this time you can also switch between pictures and image descirption is shown
